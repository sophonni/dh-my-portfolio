## Evaluation

Based on the introduction and exploration of this DH project, it is clear that it is a color-coded digital map of the United States designed to provide users with a brief summary of specific locations. When a user clicks on a specific location, information such as demographics and historical contexts are shared. According to the website, this project was created through the collaboration of four universities: Virginia Tech, the University of Maryland, John Hopkins University, and the University of Richmond.

The HOLC grading of the cities is represented by the different sizes of the circles that appear on the map. Each grading is distinguished by four distinct colors, with green representing "Best," blue representing "Still Desirable," yellow representing "definitely declining," and red representing "Hazardous."

Users can use the map to click on those circles to learn more about the area, such as demographics and a brief explanation of why that section of the area is given that grading.

This website may be useful for adults who want to settle down and raise a family in a convenient and safe location, for example. They can get a quick understanding of why the area was given a certain grading and how it will affect them in the future by using this website. For example, in Detroit, Michigan, the circle representing "yellow" and "red" grading is significantly larger than the circle representing "green" and "blue" grading.

According to my analysis, the tool makes use of technologies such as a historical database, georeference of the US map, and possibly machine learning to investigate the trends of what/why certain areas receive certain HOLC grading.

One of this website's strengths is that it is very user friendly, especially with the clear visualization and exercise layout of the map. Users can fully access the project without having to download any external sources from the website.

The weak point of this project is that the interface is not completely slick compared to the modernized project. For example, the map felt jerky when zoomed in and out compared to the maps I normally work with.

Why is there a huge amount of data/descriptions depicting cities in Massachusetts, but no descriptions or details for Montana?
