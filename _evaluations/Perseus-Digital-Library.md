## Evaluation

Guided Questions
        1. What kind of project is this? A digital repository? GIS? Natural 
        Language Processing? A tool?
        2. Who is behind the project?
        3. What are the project goals?
        4. What kind of questions does the project answer?
        5. What kind of questions can the project be used to answer?
        6. What technologies are involved?
        7. What are the strengths of the project?
        8. How might the project be involved?

Based on reading the website, the largest mission is to make the full record 
of humanity - linguistic sources, physical artifacts, historical spaces - 
as intellectually accessible as possible to every human being, regardless of 
linguistic or cultural background.

As I explored the website, here are my answers to the above questions:
        1. I think this project represents some sort of Digital repository 
        due to the number of tools and resources that are linked to other 
        sources. Some of these are:
                a. Built-in translational tools
                b. The machine is actionable (the user can interact with 
                the website)
                c. It’s also considered to be an open-source DH project 
                where all the codes and any used tools or resources are 
                publicly available
        2. People who were/are involved in this project are Professor Gregory 
        Crane, Tufts University, and other students/research assistants.
        3. The goal of this project is to make the text available in multiple 
        different languages such as Greek and Latin as well as the 
        translation aspect which they’ve accomplished. Another goal of theirs 
        is to answer the question “How would you work with languages you 
        don’t know?”
        4. Some of the questions which the project has answered are: For 
        example, you need a copy of Homozeliot. By accessing the website, 
        you have access to not just the copy of Homozeliot, you also have 
        access to other sources that are related to the copy of the 
        Homozeliot. Another question can also be answered: there are tools 
        that users can use as a way to determine the difference between a 
        plural and a singular verb.
        5. In terms of the question in the project that can be used to 
        answer, let’s say you want to read the text in other languages or 
        English versions, the website has the ability for users to compare 
        text across languages.
        6. Optical Character Recognizer was the type of technology presented 
        on the website.
        7. The idea of it being free to use, old but reliable, covering tons 
        of different types of material, huge, and extensive is what makes the 
        website very strong and useful.
        8. One way the website can be improved is by, for example, one of the 
        bugs was users were unable to access the map due to some link issues. 
        Therefore, fixing the link, it can make the website more usable. 
        Another change I might want to make is to update the background of 
        the website so that it feels more welcoming and updated.
