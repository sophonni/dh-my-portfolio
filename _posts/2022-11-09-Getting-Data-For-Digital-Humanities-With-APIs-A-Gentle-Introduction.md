## Reading Evaluation 6: Getting Data for Digital Humanities with APIs: A Gentle Introduction

The contents of this program was:
        . The basics of what an API is
        . When you might want to use one
        . What kinds of institutions or collections might have APIs of potential interest to DH practitioners
        . Where to look on these sites for access to APIs
        . How to construct queries, and
        . What to do once youâ€™ve received some data!

What is API?
        API can be interpret as an electronical version of human. For instance, when human needs to complete a certain social tasks, we interact with one another using languages in addition to following rules and guidelines. While for computer, in order for it to complete any tasks dessired by clients, most program uses a method called API which is short for Application Programming Interface. With API, different parts of software system are built to communicated with one another with respect to rules and methods in order to successfully responds to client's commands or request.

        Often time, computer utalize API for backends communication in which it's not visible to clients. However, human can study and analyze the specific program in order to directly create requests and receive information in a readable format using APIs. This can be powerful in terms of data accessing and/or data manipulation. For ex: certain DH project have a built-in API where clients can interact with and gain information.

        Other API are as follows:
                RESTs API: Representational State Transfer
                HHIP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                
                These types of API can be used to get, used, or delete online data.
        
Where does API belongs withint Digital Humanities?
        APIs allow you to request and receive specific bits of data from large corpuses of information created by cultural heritage organizations and other data creators. That data will be delivered to you in a predictable and machine-readable format, such as JSON or RDF, and will be divided into metadata categories determined by the institution that created the data.

        The API also allows continuous retrieval if the data matching the parameters is updated frequently. This is generally how developers use APIs. It's a way to repeatedly access data and pull it into your app or program without going through the UI.

        Another way API can be useful is when clients like us want to download not all the data available on the site, nor individual records, but some data. It also helps if you have at least some familiarity with the information available and the metadata used to describe it. In many ways, it's similar to using the Advanced Find feature, except that instead of a result page with a scrolling UI, you can retrieve chunks of data that you can further refine and edit.
