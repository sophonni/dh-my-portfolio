## Reading Evaluation 1: The Humanities by Willem Dress

When hearing the term "Humanities", first thought that comes to mind is that it's the study of English Language & Literatur, History, Classic, and Religious study. However, after reading and evaluating the chapter, Deer's defination to "Humanities" is immensly vage but meaningful. Back in history, Willem Drees stated "Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world they live in." (7). Fast forward to current day society, "Humanities" are refer to any feild of study that is outside of professional field, mathematic, science, and social science.

At the start of his chapter, Drees made it cleared that "we are human studying human". Based on his text, he made that claim that this is what seperate humanities from other diciplinary field of study. In addtion to this, this quote also haracterize the idea of "second-order" of human nature where it notify that "there must be humann before humanities" (13). With combining the above ideas, Drees pits the humanities as a distinctively humanistic discipline which focuses strongly on the expressive and meaning-laden aspects of culture, art, and history.
