## Reading Evaluation 1: The Humanities by Willem Dress


At the start of his chapter, Drees made it clear that "we are human studying human". Based on his text, he claimed that this is what separates humanities from other disciplinary fields of study. In addition to this, this quote also characterized the idea of "second-order" of human nature where it notify that "there must be human before humanities" (13). By combining the above ideas, Drees pits the humanities as a distinctively humanistic discipline that focuses strongly on the expressive and meaning-laden aspects of culture, art, and history.

As I pursued reading the chapter, he also discussed the similarity and dissimilarities between humanities and science. One of the similarities he proposed was "what is out there?" In science, for example, physics, we study Albert Einstein's law of general relativity, quantum theory, Newton's Law, etc. In Biology, we study micro-organisms, plants, animals, the human body, etc. And likewise, humanities will provides us with particular knowledge of the context in different functionalities of different fields of human culture.  As we all know, our universe is significantly diverse ranging from languages, history, artistic expression, etc. All of which are worthy to study, analyze, and learn from.

Another similarity that I found interesting is the idea of finding patterns when humans study humans whether is language, literature, and/or other texts, human art, etc. These types of studies aren't just seeking to find the meaning of the pattern. These patterns are being studied and analyzed with the focus of finding the author's intention and the programmatic way in which the contexts are used as opposed to the general study of pattern recognition.
