## Reading Evaluation 5: Introduction to the Digital Humanities and The Organization of Humanities Research by Gardiner and Musto

One of the central topics addressed in Gardiner and Musto's article "Introduction to the Digital Humanities" was, "Is the digital hurting the humanities by drawing scholars away from the traditional work of humanists and turning them into number crunchers or bell-and-whistle builders?" Gardiner and Musto (pg. 5) While some may regard this as a valid concern, others contend that the "marriage" (pg. 1) of digital and humanities can intersect while each can be deployed independently for separate responsibilities. As stated in that article, Roberto Busa's introduction of digital and humanities in 1949 "opened new research methods" (pg. 3) by assisting humanist scholars in working "more quickly and efficiently."

While digital technology is a useful tool that can help the humanities, it should never be used to replace the work of humanists. Aulus Gellius' definition of "humanitas," which includes "learning and instruction in good or liberal arts," is incomplete without the digital component (pg. 8). In their article "The Organization of Humanities Research," Gardiner and Musto describe the differences between humanities, social sciences, and physical sciences by addressing how each interprets and "represents evidence" (pg. 5). Even Thomas Jefferson, who advocated for new sciences at the time, valued the liberal arts. While the various disciplines can intersect like Venn diagrams and enhance the elements in other fields, they are also very distinct.
