## Reading Evaluation 4: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

The Roman Empire was founded in 27 B.C. and was centered on the city of Rome. It was founded after the fall of the Roman Republic and lasted until the last solar eclipse of the Western Empire in the 5th century AD. Here's a brief treatment of the Roman Empire: See "Ancient Rome" for the full cure.

A period of political unrest and civil war in the 1st century BC. BC marks the transition of Rome from a republic to an empire. This period included the career of Julius Caesar, who eventually took full control of Rome as dictator. After being assassinated in 44 BC. A triumvirate of Mark Antonius, Lepidus, Octavian, and Caesar's nephew ruled. It wasn't long before Octavian went to war in North Africa against Antony, and his victory at Actium (31 BC) was followed by the coronation of Augustus, Rome's first emperor. His reign is from 27 BC. Until 14 AD, it was characterized by stability and peace.

Domitian was replaced by Marcus Cocceius Nerva (96–98), an older senator of some importance. Among the beloved Roman rulers who succeeded him were Trajan (98-117), Hadrian (117-138), Antoninus Pius (138-161), Marcus Aurelius (161 ~ 180 years). Collectively these are known as his Five Good Emperors. Their non-genetic inheritance ushered in a golden age of considerable expansion and consolidation. But all the changes that happened during this period, however beneficial they were, had the attendant detriment of excessive centralization. The concentration of the empire in the hands of an emperor (young, incompetent and decadent) like Commodus (180–192) was enough to lead the empire into decline.

The next century was plagued by strife and mismanagement. When Septimius Severus, commander of the Danube army, came to power in his 193 year, he effectively turned Rome into a military monarchy. The "barbarian invasion" weighed as much as the seizure of empires and political destabilization. Instability has fueled itself and caused many lives and treasures to be lost. Economic turmoil continued for decades due to trade turmoil, heavy taxation, inflation and extortion from the garrison.

During most of the later republics and empires, Rome was the dominant power in the Mediterranean, most of Western Europe, and most of North Africa. , urban planning and political applications, but also recognized and adopted contributions from other ancient peoples.
