## Reading Evaluation 2: As We May Know by Vannevar Bush

Based on the article, the main question that Vannevar is trying to ask is "What was there to do now, for scientist?" 

Vannevar Bush was known to be one of the leaders on the Manhattan Project which developed the atomic bomb during the time of WWII. To most scientists, WWII was a time of new discovery and mass technological and theoretical advancement. After the war end, scientist goals became vague. Based on his article, he intensively focus on the idea of human memory and human ability to catolog, categorize, and recollect the totality of human information. He states: “Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual” (Bush 2). With the ability to preserve information far beyond the lifespan of any individual, the problem then comes of how to access and disseminate that information in a valuable way. As Bush notes, “[a] record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted” (Bush 3).

Finally, Bush arrives at his ultimate machine, "the memex," and illuminates the ultimate problem: "Thus far, we appear to be worse off than before—for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its current bulk, we can hardly consult it." This is a much broader issue than simply extracting data for scientific research; it encompasses the entire process by which man profits from his inherited knowledge" (Bush 8). Bush's solution to the problem of information consultation is the memex, a desk with two screens, switches and leavers, and magnetic tape for recording and storing data. Aside from technical details, the memex's brilliance and approach to the problem of information access is by way of associative indexing. Basically, Bush conceived of a machine that worked in much the same way the world wide web does by way of associations and hypertextuality. By creating “trails” of associated information, one could create and share collections of connected data which would not only be more intuitive, but would rapidly increase the speed and depth of research and information sharing.
