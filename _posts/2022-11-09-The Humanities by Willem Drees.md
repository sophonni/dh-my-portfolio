## Reading Evaluation 5: The Humanities by Willem Drees

Without a fix describes the word, it is difficult to initiate a research question or topic in the humanities. Willem B. Drees' book discusses multiple possible definitions of the term "humanities," as well as other scholars' definitions. "The book includes a plurality of scholarly disciplines such as the study of history, languages, religions, science, and art from various times and places, and often comparatively, linguistics, literary studies, cultural studies, philosophy, religious studies, and area studies," Dree writes.

The author defined humanities as "academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world in which they live." The definition defined by the author was successful in one aspect. It gives readers broad ideas that describe humanities as a whole. On the other hand, it failed to identify the research objectives in the various.

Although the definition does not explicitly list the "humanities disciplines," it served a general purpose in terms of understanding the subject's goals and purposes. Furthermore, it raised the concept of a different order of activity, defining it as a second-order activity-the academix study of humnan's action.
